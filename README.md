# Podium Coding Challenge 
Ruby code to scrape reviews for Mckaig Chevorlet and output the top 3 most "overly positive" reviews to the console.
These top offenders are based first off the overall rating given (0-50) and then by the length of the review written (longer is more overly postive).

# Ruby Gems Needed
nokogiri, open-uri, rspec

# Running Instructions
